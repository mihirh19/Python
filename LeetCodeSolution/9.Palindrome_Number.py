"""
Given an integer x, return true if x is a
palindrome
, and false otherwise.



Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1


Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
